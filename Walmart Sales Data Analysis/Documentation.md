# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore Walmart's sales data to understand top-performing branches and products, identify sales trends, and analyze customer behavior. The goal is to determine how sales strategies can be improved and optimized. The dataset includes historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores located in various regions, with selected holiday markdown events included, complicating sales predictions.

## Purposes of the Project
The primary aim of this project is to gain insights into Walmart's sales data, focusing on the different factors that affect sales across various branches.

## Analysis List
### Product Analysis
Conduct an analysis to identify different product lines, evaluate which are performing best, and determine which need improvement.

### Sales Analysis
This analysis will explore product sales trends, helping to measure the effectiveness of current sales strategies and suggesting modifications for increased sales.

### Customer Analysis
Uncover different customer segments, purchasing trends, and the profitability of each segment.

## Approach Used
- 1. **Data Wrangling and Management Steps:**
  - **Data Inspection:** Inspected the dataset to identify NULL and missing values for a clean analysis.
  - **Database Management:** Built a database and created tables with appropriate data types.
  - **Data Insertion:** Inserted the cleaned data into the database, ensuring all fields were set to NOT NULL.
- 2. **Feature Engineering:** This will help use generate some new columns from existing ones.
   1. Add a new column named `time_of_day` to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.
   2. Add a new column named `day_name` that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.
   3. Add a new column named `month_name` that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). Help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.
- 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted to address the projectâ€™s key questions.

## Technologies Used
The primary technology used is **SQL**. Here are the specific SQL-related aspects:
- **Database Management**: Creating and managing a database (e.g., `CREATE DATABASE walmartSales;`).
- The Databse is created [Create_DB](https://github.com/Ak-AlphaData/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Walmart%20Sales%20Data%20Analysis/Creating%20DB%20Walmart.sql)

- **Table Creation**: Defining the schema for the sales data, including columns and data types (e.g., `CREATE TABLE sales (...);`).
- **Data Insertion**: Inserting the sales data into the created tables using `INSERT` statements.
- **Data Queries**: Running various `SELECT` queries to retrieve insights from the data, such as:
  - Unique cities
  - Total revenue by month
  - Most common product lines
  - Customer segmentation
- **Data Manipulation**: Using SQL functions to aggregate data, calculate totals, derive metrics (e.g., `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`), And using Advanced SQL like subqueries and CTEs to reduce the time takesn to retrive the data.
- **Joins**: Using `JOIN` statements to combine data from multiple tables for deeper analysis.
- **Stored Procedures/Functions**: Writing procedures or functions to automate repetitive tasks or complex calculations.

Overall, SQL serves as the sole technology for managing, analyzing, and deriving insights from the Walmart sales data.

## Revenue and Profit Calculations
- **COGS** = unit_price Ã— quantity
- **VAT** = 5% Ã— COGS
- **Total (Gross Sales)** = VAT + COGS
- **Gross Profit (Gross Income)** = Total (Gross Sales) - COGS
- **Gross Margin** = (Gross Income / Total Revenue) Ã— 100

### Example Calculation
**Data Given**:
- Unit Price = 45.79
- Quantity = 7

**Calculations**:
- COGS = 45.79 Ã— 7 = 320.53
- VAT = 5% Ã— COGS = 5% Ã— 320.53 = 16.03
- Total = VAT + COGS = 16.03 + 320.53 = 336.56
- Gross Margin Percentage = (Gross Income / Total Revenue) = (16.03 / 336.56) â‰ˆ 4.76%
