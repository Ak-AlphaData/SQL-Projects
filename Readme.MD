# SQL Projects Repository  

Welcome to the SQL Projects Repository! This repository houses various SQL projects that demonstrate data analysis, management, and querying capabilities across different datasets. Each project folder contains specific analysis focused on uncovering insights, optimizing performance, and facilitating data-driven decision-making.  

## Project Structure  
The repository is organized into several project folders, each containing the following:  

- **SQL Queries**: A `.sql` file with all the queries used in the analysis.  
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for the analysis (if applicable).  
- **README.md**: A project-specific README file detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, and insights.
